Today I had a medicore day at work because I didn't have any dragons to slay, or grand goals in mind.

Today was amazon prime day but I didn't see anything on there that I wanted except for a bug net for a hammock, which I've used once this year.

I bought 16 fragrance samples for $60 but checked off almost every fragrance I've been wanting to try, except the cheapies.

Didn't install screen hunter free cuz the file size was too big 101mb... come on...

Watched some amazing attack on titan - on season 3 episode 15 now

Read some good stuff in my books - tribe of mentors, deep simplicity and radical acceptance

Told ol teal to reject camila with two words, Who's tickle
    - After he bailed on our plans to hang out cuz she was an hour late...

Ate very clean, only grainish thing was hummus.

Didn't like the way I looked with my new haircut and my glasses... sometimes...

I can feel my wrist tingling using this flat keyboard...

talked to liz :p
