Today I did a couple things that I could write about, listed below

 - Looked up fragrances and videos about them
 - Watched about 2 or 3 hours of LCS league of legends
 - Watched some attack on titan
 - Read some in Guns, Germs and Steel
 - Talked to a few girls on tinder
 - Snapped some friends
 - Read "Liking what you see" by Ted Chiang about how beauty influences us so much and how the world changes when we turn that bias off
    - https://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/1048692/Chiang_-_Liking_What_You_See__A_Documentary.html (Not sure if this is what it cliams to be...)

Let me know which of these things you'd like to hear about.
