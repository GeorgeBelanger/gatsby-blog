Today I turned my screen so my boss could see what I am doing and not only am I much more productive, but I'm much happier and focused. Before I would just surf the web and screw off (which I still did when he left the room for an hour) and say I don't want to do this now... but even when I didn't feel like doing something I would stare at the screen for like 30 seconds before I just said ok lets do it. For that reason good day but other than that I was disappointed by John Varatos Artisan Acqua. The smell isn't great and the performace seems to be bad. I am sticking to the most renouned frags from now on. A couple others that seemed interesting and that I wanted to try like the dior homme line but I'm good.
